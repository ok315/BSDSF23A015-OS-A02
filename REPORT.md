# REPORT.md — Feature 1: Project Setup and Initial Build

## Objective:
Set up the project structure for re-implementing the `ls` command using the provided starter code and build system.

## Tasks Completed:

- ✅ Created a new GitHub repository: `BSDSF23A015-OS-A02`.
- ✅ Cloned the repo locally using `git clone`.
- ✅ Copied the following files from the instructor's starter project:
  - `src/ls-v1.0.0.c`
  - `Makefile`
- ✅ Created required directories: `bin/`, `obj/`, `man/`.
- ✅ Created an empty `REPORT.md` file (now updated with this content).
- ✅ Successfully compiled the code using the provided `Makefile`.
- ✅ Verified the compiled program runs:
  - `./bin/ls` correctly lists files in the current directory.
  - `./bin/ls -l` displays long listing format.
  - `./bin/ls -a` and `-R` are not supported yet (will be implemented in later features).
